Youtube Dark
============

Dark CSS style for YouTube

That's just a CSS sheet that you can load within your browser to modify the YouTube style (with Chrome you can use the plugin Stylish).
Check the picture to see what it looks like.

Pro:
---
- Optimized for full HD screens.
- Beautiful and clean style.
  - Dark style.
  - Shadows.
  - Hover effects.
  - Round pictures.
  - Totally reworked search bar.
      - Fully integrated in the background.
      - Transparency effects on the background of the dropdown menu.
      
- Doesn't bother your eyes because of the white background.
- Doesn't p*sses you off because everything is now centered!

- Kills all the adds (but the ones in the video obviously).
- Hides the not desired suggestions.
- Kills the awful Vevo background.


Con:
---
- Doesn't work since YouTube updated his CSS...
- Sometimes even the relevant suggestion section is hidden.
- Only works with the fully enlarged video mode. Otherwise the playlist controller bugs.
